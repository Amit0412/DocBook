 • INTRODUCTION
 
 A Multistage graph is a directed, weighted graph in which the nodes can be divided into a set of stages such that all edges are from a stage to next stage only 
 
 (In other words there is no edge between vertices of same stage and from a vertex of current stage to previous stage).
