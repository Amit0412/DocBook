# Loops

## What are Loops?

In C++ programming, loops are used to perform a set of instructions repeatedly until a certain condition is met. 

## Types of Loops 

There are three types of loops in C++: for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.

## Short Explanation

"For loops" allow you to execute a block of code a specific number of times, while "while loops" and "do-while loops" allow you to execute a block of code until a certain condition is satisfied. These loops provide an efficient way to perform repetitive tasks, allowing you to avoid writing redundant code.
